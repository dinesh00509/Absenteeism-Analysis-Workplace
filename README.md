# Absenteeism Analysis Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for my first data science project, focusing on the analysis of absenteeism in the workplace. The goal of the project is to gain insights into absenteeism patterns, identify potential factors influencing absenteeism, and provide valuable information for decision-making.
